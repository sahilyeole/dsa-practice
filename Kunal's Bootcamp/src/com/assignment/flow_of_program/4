FOR HCF [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers]
Define two variables a and b
   FOR i = 1 TO MAX(a, b) DO
      IF a % i is 0 AND b % i is 0 THEN
         HCF = i
      ENDIF
   ENDFOR
   DISPLAY HCF

FOR LCM [The LCM of two integers n1 and n2 is the smallest positive integer that is perfectly divisible by both n1 and n2]

An efficient solution is based on the below formula for LCM of two numbers ‘a’ and ‘b’. [eucledian algorith]
a x b = LCM(a, b) * GCD (a, b)
#(gcd = hcf)

lcm = (a / hcf) * b
