Let's break down the code and explain each section with comments and an example.

javascript
Copy code
function twoCrystalBall(arr) {
This is the function that takes an array as input and returns the index of the spot where the crystal ball breaks or -1 if the ball doesn't break within the array.

javascript
Copy code
  // Calculate jump length with sqrt of array length
  const jumpLength = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(arr.length));
This calculates the jump length, which is the interval that the first crystal ball will use to jump through the array. We use the Math.sqrt function to calculate the square root of the length of the input array, and then round it down to the nearest integer using Math.floor.

Example: If the length of the input array is 100, the jump length will be 10.

javascript
Copy code
  let i = 0;

  // Leaping through array with distance of jump length in each leap
  for (; i < arr.length; i = i + jumpLength) {
    if (arr[i] == 1) {
      break;
    }
  }
This loop is the first part of the algorithm that uses the first crystal ball to jump through the array in intervals of the jump length. The loop starts at the beginning of the array (index 0) and jumps through the array in intervals of the jump length. If the ball breaks at a certain index, we break out of the loop.

Example: If the jump length is 10, the loop will start at index 0, then jump to index 10, then index 20, and so on. If the ball breaks at index 30, we break out of the loop.

less
Copy code
  // Going back by one leap to start walking using linear search
  i = i - jumpLength;
After the first loop, we need to go back by one jump length so that we can start the second part of the algorithm, which is a linear search within a certain range.

Example: If the ball breaks at index 30, and the jump length is 10, we go back to index 20 so that we can start the linear search from index 20.

sql
Copy code
  // Walk one by one using linear search
  for (let j = i; j < i + jumpLength; j++) {
    if (arr[j] == 1) {
      return j;
    }
  }
This loop is the second part of the algorithm that uses the second crystal ball to perform a linear search within the range that we found in the first loop. The loop starts at the index where we went back to (i) and goes up to i+jumpLength. We check each index to see if the ball breaks
